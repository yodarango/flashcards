# TODO

- Eventually, I need to separate each language into its on array. This will allow me to include more languages without having to load them both in the same object, which will get quite BIG!

  ### Structure

  The data structure should be as follows:

  - Each language must be contained in its own array.
  - The word's type should be of `{uniqueId: word}`, where the uniqueId for the word is the same across all languages, serving as an indexer and a relationship key.
  - The words set type should be similar to what it is right now and keeping its own word categorization.

  # IDEAS

  - Turn this into an rpg where users defeat monsters as they progress? ....hhmm ðŸ¤”
  - make an app for my wife where she can rectify them all
